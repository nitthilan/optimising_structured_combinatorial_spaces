Spare TSV Allocation to Enhance the Lifetime of High-Performance 3D NoCs: A Structured Bayesian Optimization Approach

B. Outline of the paper

1) Introduction

2) Related Work

3) TSV Reliability

- We need to summarize both electromigration and cross-talk capacitance from Sourav's DATE paper succinctly.

4) Problem Setup and Challenges

5) Structured Bayesian Optimization Methodology

5.1 General BO Framework

- Gaussian Processes and Kernels

- Mean and Variance computation

- Acquisition Function: Role and concrete examples (Expected Improvement and Upper Confidence Bounds)

All the existing work on BO is in continuous spaces. However, we are dealing with combinatorial structured spaces.

5.2 Structured Bayesian Optimization Algorithm

- Kernels over structured objects 

- STAGE Algorithm for acquisition function optimization

5.3 Instantiation for Spare TSV Allocation

- Graph Kernels and Weisfelleher Lehman kernel

- Domain knowledge from cross-talk capacitance analysis

6) Experiments and Results

6.1 Experimental Setup

- Benchmarks

- 3D NoC Architecture

- Baselines: Greedy algorithm from Krish's paper and Exhaustive search

- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy (Lifetime), Number of simulations, and Raw computation time.

6.2 Results for Spare VL Allocation: Exhaustive Search vs. SBO

- Compare exhaustive search and SBO for small spare VL budget. This is to make the point that we can reach optimal solutions with a small number of simulations.

- Accuracy, number of simulations, and raw computation time.

6.3 Results for Spare TSV Allocation

- Comparison of Accuracy: Greedy vs. SBO

- Comparison of number of simulations: Greedy vs. SBO vs. Exhaustive search

- Comparison of raw computation time: Greedy vs. SBO vs. Exhaustive search

- Solutions from Greedy vs. SBO: Qualitative Analysis
